          Our customers love everything this UK art brand stands for – quality products that are exceptionally well
          presented. If you are looking for cheap art supplies Zieler may not be for you, but if you are looking for

          Trusted by Artists
        </h3>
        <p class="text">
          The main difference with Zieler compared to other art materials we stock at Lorimers is that its products,
          have been tested and approved by artists!
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Often with a new purchase, it’s difficult knowing the quality of art paints, brushes and even paper until
          you’ve actually used the items by which time it’s too late to return them if you’re not happy with them! So
          with Zieler our customers are always reassured by the fact that artists have given their stamp of approval.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Zieler acrylic paint pens have been perhaps the most popular with our customers closely followed by the kit
          for lino printing.

        Help with Art during Covid-19
      </h3>
      <section class="text">
        <p>
          In these difficult times with Covid-19, people have looked to art as a relaxing pass time. With all of our
          shops closed many of our customers were looking to start painting, drawing and sketching but had no idea of
          which products they would need.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zieler has been there to support our customers on everything from how to get started with watercolour
          painting
          to which calligraphy set they should consider. If this was not enough, they also put on free art classes for
          people to follow and make the most of their purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hopefully, it will not be too much longer before our customers can return to our shops and get their hands
          on
          Zieler supplies as well as everything else we offer.
