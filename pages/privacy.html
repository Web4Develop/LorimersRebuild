          JH Lorimer Ltd is committed to protecting your privacy. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a
          landmark privacy law affecting the European Union (EU). The following outlines the efforts of JH Lorimer Ltd
          to
          become compliant with the GDPR by the regulation deadline of May 25, 2018.

              The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a new privacy legislation that replaces the EU Data
              Protection
              Directive (Directive 95/46/EC) within the European Union. The GDPR regulates the collection, use,
              transfer,
              and
              sharing of personal data with the key purpose of protecting it.

            Personal data includes any information related to a living resident or citizen of the EU that can be used to
            directly or indirectly identify the person. It can be anything from a name, a photo, an email address,
            medical
            information, or even an IP address or cookie.

            Who does the GDPR affect?
          </summary>
          <p class="body">
            The GDPR affects companies processing the personal data of individuals residing in the European Union,
            regardless of a company’s location. It applies not only to organisations located within the EU, but also
            to
            organisations located outside of the EU if they offer goods or services to or monitor the behaviour of EU
            residents and/or citizens.

          <p class="body">
            The GDPR requires organisations to be transparent on how personal data is collected, used, and stored.
            This
            requires transparency from organisations on what personal data is collected, purposes for which it is
            collected,
            and who it is shared with. It also requires companies to enable individuals whose personal data is being
            processed to exercise their rights in relation to their data. The GDPR also requires companies to ensure
            appropriate protections when EU personal data is transferred outside the EU.
